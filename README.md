# stanR_workshop

A workshop on using Stan with R.  It was actually more of a talk as there wasn't a hands on component, and it may or may not have included slides that try to convert people to the Bayesian way via subliminal images of Bob Ross, lamborghinis, and kittens.  [Link to the relevant doc](http://m-clark.github.io/workshops/bayesian/).
